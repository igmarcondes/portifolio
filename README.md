#Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

This is the second challenge developed during the ONE - Oracle Next Education program, with the aim of putting the studied contents into practice.
The challenge is to create my portfolio using the knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript acquired during the classes.
Cards were made available in Trello to guide and manage the development of the project and a standard template for styling in Figma.


#My project

I always try to keep my code as organized as possible, to make it easier to understand and access if something needs to change.
